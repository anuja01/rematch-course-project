You can find complete video course on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNG2YBDrzK-w1VSeDpMxdGwkb4L6hDy8Z)

# Advantages of Rematch   
1. Removes unwanted redux boilerplate codes (no need of action types, action creators, reducers with switch)   
2. Out of the box support for side effects (not necessary to use saga, thunk)
